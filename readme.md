## 01 Create Hello World Function

### [Problem Statement ↗️](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-hello-world-function/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript)

Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".

### Solution

```js
function createHelloWorld() {
  return function (...args): string {
    return "Hello World";
  };
}
/*
 * const f = createHelloWorld();
 * f(); // "Hello World"
 */
```

### Explanation

Inside the return statement of the createHelloWorld function we just have to return the string "Hello World" as it is a simple hello world program.

## 02 Counter

### [Problem Statement ↗️](https://leetcode.com/problems/counter/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript)

Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

### Solution

```js
function createCounter(n: number): () => number {
  let number = n - 1;
  return function () {
    number += 1;
    return number;
  };
}

/*
 * const counter = createCounter(10)
 * counter() // 10
 * counter() // 11
 * counter() // 12
 */
```

### Explanation

The problem says that it will return n in first go and then for next call to the function it will return n+1 everytime. So for this problem we need to use **closure**.

```js
let number = n - 1;
```

By declaring a new variable inside the createCounter and storing the **n - 1** in it as the statement want **n** in the first call so when we will increase the value of number by 1 it will be equal to the n itself for the first go and then will increase by 1 in subsequent calls.

```js
return function () {
  number += 1;
  return number;
};
```

After this we can simply increase the value of number by 1 inside the inner function and return it. The inner function will have the access of its outer scope as it is forming closure with createCounter function.

## 03 To Be Or Not To Be

### [Problem Statement ↗️](https://leetcode.com/problems/to-be-or-not-to-be/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript)

Write a function expect that helps developers test their code. It should take in any value val and return an object with the following two functions.

**toBe(val)** accepts another value and returns true if the two values === each other. If they are not equal, it should throw an error "Not Equal".

**notToBe(val)** accepts another value and returns true if the two values !== each other. If they are equal, it should throw an error "Equal".

### Solution

```js
type ToBeOrNotToBe = {
  toBe: (val: any) => boolean,
  notToBe: (val: any) => boolean,
};

function expect(val: any): ToBeOrNotToBe {
  return {
    toBe: (value: any) => {
      if (value === val) {
        return true;
      } else {
        throw "Not Equal";
      }
    },
    notToBe: (value: any) => {
      if (value !== val) {
        return true;
      } else {
        throw "Equal";
      }
    },
  };
}

/**
 * expect(5).toBe(5); // true
 * expect(5).notToBe(5); // throws "Equal"
 */
```

### Explanation

This problem statement states that for toBe, if the argument of toBe and expect function are equal then the toBe should return true else should throw new error "Not Equal".

Same thing is required for notToBe as it will return true if its argument and expect function argument is not same else should throw new error "Equal".

So I am simply returning an object from expect having two keys one as toBe and second one as notToBe which is using if and else to check that the argument of theirs is matching with the expect function or not and then returning the respective answer.
